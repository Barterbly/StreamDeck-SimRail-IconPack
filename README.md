StreamDeck icons for SimRail - The Railway Simulator

I've created these icons to use them in my Stream Deck (XXL version). In [SimRail - The Railway Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422130/SimRail__The_Railway_Simulator/) you can set your own keybind to some in-game actions, and then set them in Stream Deck. Of course there were no icons pack to match this simulator, so I've created them by myself.
